# Intermittent API Route Failure in Next.js 15

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15 where API routes intermittently fail to respond. The issue manifests as requests hanging indefinitely, resulting in a perpetually loading state in the client application.

## Bug Description

API routes defined in `pages/api` sometimes fail to return a response. The client-side application using `useSWR` displays a loading indicator that never resolves. This behavior is not consistent; sometimes the API route works as expected.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Observe the behavior of the `/` page.  The loading indicator may persist indefinitely.  Refresh the page repeatedly to witness the inconsistent behavior.

## Potential Causes

The root cause is likely related to an interaction between Next.js 15's serverless functions, edge caching, and potentially concurrent request handling. Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the specific issue.

## Solution (Workaround)

A workaround is to add a timeout to the `fetch` or HTTP request handling.  This is not an ideal solution, as it masks rather than solves the underlying problem.
